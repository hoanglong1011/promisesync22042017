[{"id":1,"title":"IDAC","image":"142148479","note":"Synopsis: When I was leaving for college, my aunt Dana told me I had a cousin I’d never met who was matriculating in the same year as me. We shared classes and had friends in common but for some strange reason I never introduced myself. All during college, and then into the real world, through a decade of overlapping connections, we never met. This film is an examination of that hesitation and an attempt to understand why I never made the easiest connection in the world… until it was too late. Through archival footage and re-enactment of the era in question, IDAC is ultimately a documentary about what was happening on an unconscious level and how distant a relative can be even when they’re right in front of your face."},{"id":2,"title":"Mile 19","image":"208334095","note":"Some people run for exercise and others for competition, but Johnnie Jameson runs to heal.
